### Dependecies

*   python3
*   python3-opencv
*   python3-numpy
*   python3-matplotlib
*   tensorflow


### How to run

```
git clone https://github.com/klokik/RomanLetterClassificationTest.git
cd RomanLetterClassificationTest
python3 -m notebook RomanNumeralsClassification.ipynb
```

### Expected accuracy

Depending on your luck of how data samples would be splitted on training/test datasets, you may expect an accuracy in the range of `0.98` to `1.0`.
Dataset contains some quite badly written digits, and is tiny, therefore a few samples are expected to be be missclassified.
